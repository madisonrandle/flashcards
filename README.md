# Flashcards
## Abstract
This is my first solo project from Mod2 at Turing School of Software and Design. This program focuses on test driven development. the program allows a user to go through a set of flash cards using the command line. The user can see the question on each 'card' and its possible answers. At the end of each round, the user will see the percentage of questions they answered correctly with the amount of time it took them to complete the round.
